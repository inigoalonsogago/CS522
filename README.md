Final Project on the application of cross-lingual embeddings for sentiment classification


## Notes
* The file train_model_on_english trains the LSTM weight on English data dataand saves the weights of the model. 

* The file train_model_own_embeddings trains our own embeddings over the imdb datsets

* Overall_Analysis contains the error analysis of the model, after testing the Spanish corpus using the model trained on English movie reviews (the weightsof the model are loaded). It shows the accuracy of the sentiment analysis over Spanish movie reviews. Again, the preprocessing of the Spanish dataset is commented.

* The datasets and model weights that should go on the datasets folder, can be found on the following google drive link:
